* try first one robot, one order, then two etc
  - different strategies
* how to formalize "before" effecy=tively
  - old predlp?
  - sequence constraint
* use assign effectively
* why such a discrepancy

* test exits to highways
* lazy grounding for inertial objects, eg unmoved shelves
* hitting set
  - shelfs covering all orders
* do we have conditional effects
* pretty printer for answer sets
  - static
  - states
  - actions
* lc2casp system?
* frame axiom between selected points
  - start(O,S), pickup(O,S),etc
* strategy
  - satisfy orders with sheld with enough products
  - take maximum number of items
* benchmark generation
* tester program
* student coordination
* | viz ?
* show mixed terms (action+quantity)
* parallel deliver and picks
* configuration of encodings
* C!=C vs two not
* amt(0) vs amt(N), N > 0
